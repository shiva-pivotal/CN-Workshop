= Adding Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker and Dashboard

== Overview

[.lead]
In this lab we'll utilize Spring Boot and Spring Cloud to make our UI Application more resilient.  We'll leverage Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker to configure our application behavior when our downstream dependencies are not available.  Finally, we'll use the circuit breaker dashboard to view metrics of the circuit breaker we implemented, which will be auto-provisioned within Pivotal Cloud Foundry Spring Cloud Services.

== Define a Circuit Breaker within the _UI Application_

. These features are added by adding `spring-cloud-services-starter-circuit-breaker` to Maven project dependencies:
+
.cloud-native-spring-ui/pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.pivotal.spring.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-services-starter-circuit-breaker</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

. The first thing we need to add to our application is an `@EnableCircuitBreaker` annotation to the Spring Boot application.  Add this annotation to the `CloudNativeSpringUIApplication` class:
+
.cloud-native-spring-ui/src/main/java/io/pivotal/cloudnativespringui/CloudNativeSpringUiApplication.java
[source,java,numbered]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableFeignClients
@EnableDiscoveryClient
@EnableCircuitBreaker // <---- Add this
public class CloudNativeSpringUiApplication {
    [...]
}
----

. When we introduced the `@FeignClient` into our application we were only required to provide an interface.  We'll provide a dummy class that implements that interface for our fallback.  We'll also reference that class as a fallback in our `@FeignClient` annotation.  First, create this inner class in the `CloudNativeSpringUiApplication` class:
+
.cloud-native-spring-ui/src/main/java/io/pivotal/cloudnativespringui/CloudNativeSpringUiApplication.java
[source,java,numbered]
----
@Component
public class CityClientFallback implements CityClient {
    @Override
    public Resources<City> getCities() {
        // We'll just return an empty response
        return new Resources<City>(Collections.emptyList());
    }
}
----
+
. Also modify the `@FeignClient` annotation to reference this class as the fallback in case of failure:
+
.cloud-native-spring-ui/src/main/java/io/pivotal/cloudnativespringui/CloudNativeSpringUiApplication.java
[source,java,numbered]
----
@FeignClient(name = "cloud-native-spring", fallback = CityClientFallback.class)
public interface CityClient {
    [...]
}
----
+
. Your Boot Application should now look like this _CloudNativeSpringUiApplication_:
+
.cloud-native-spring-ui/src/main/java/io/pivotal/cloudnativespringui/CloudNativeSpringUiApplication.java
[source,java,numbered]
----
package io.pivotal.cloudnativespringui;

import java.util.Collections;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.circuitbreaker.EnableCircuitBreaker;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.feign.EnableFeignClients;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.feign.FeignClient;
import org.springframework.hateoas.Resources;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;

import io.pivotal.cloudnativespring.domain.City;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableFeignClients
@EnableDiscoveryClient
@EnableCircuitBreaker
public class CloudNativeSpringUiApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(CloudNativeSpringUiApplication.class, args);
    }

    @FeignClient(name = "cloud-native-spring", fallback = CityClientFallback.class)
    public interface CityClient {
        @GetMapping(value = "/cities", consumes = "application/hal+json")
        Resources<City> getCities();
    }

    @Component
    public class CityClientFallback implements CityClient {
        @Override
        public Resources<City> getCities() {
            // We'll just return an empty response
            return new Resources<City>(Collections.emptyList());
        }
    }
}
----

. To enable Feign Hystrix support, we'll need to add the following to our Spring Boot configuration:
+
.cloud-native-spring-ui/src/main/resources/application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
feign:
  hystrix:
    enabled: true
----
+
Completed:
+
.cloud-native-spring-ui/src/main/resources/application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  application:
    name: cloud-native-spring-ui

feign:
  hystrix:
    enabled: true

security:
  basic:
    enabled: false
----

== Create the Circuit Breaker Dashboard

.  When we modified our application to use a Hystrix Circuit Breaker our application automatically begins streaming out metrics about the health of our methods wrapped with a HystrixCommand.  We can stream these events through a AMQP message bus into Turbine to view on a Circuit Breaker dashboard.  This can be done through Cloud Foundry using the services marketplace by executing the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
CN-Workshop/labs/my_work/cloud-native-spring-ui $ cf create-service p-circuit-breaker-dashboard standard circuit-breaker-dashboard
----

. If we view the Circuit Breaker Dashboard (accessible from the *Manage* link in Apps Manager) you will see that a dashboard has been deployed but is empty (You may get an _initializing_ message for a few seconds.  This should eventually refresh to a dashboard):
+
image::images/dash.jpg[]

. We will now bind our application to our `circuit-breaker-dashboard` within our Cloud Foundry deployment manifest:
+
.cloud-native-spring-ui/manifest.yml
[source,yml]
----
  services:
  - service-registry
  - circuit-breaker-dashboard # <---- Add this
----

== Deploy and test application

. Build the application
+
[source,bash]
----
CN-Workshop/labs/my_work/cloud-native-spring-ui $ ./mvnw package
----

. Push application to Cloud Foundry
+
[source,bash]
----
CN-Workshop/labs/my_work/cloud-native-spring-ui $ cf push
----

. Test your application by navigating to the root URL of the application.  If the dependent cities REST service is still stopped, you should simply see a blank table.  Remember that last time you received a nasty exception in the browser?  Now your Circuit Breaker fallback method is automatically called and the fallback behavior is executed.
+

. From a commandline start the cloud-native-spring microservice (the original city service, not the new UI)
+
[source,bash]
----
CN-Workshop/labs/my_work/cloud-native-spring $ cf start cloud-native-spring
----

. Refresh the UI app and you should once again see a table listing the first page of cities.
+

. Refresh your UI application a few times to force some traffic though the circuit breaker call path.  After doing this you should now see the dashboard populated with metrics about the health of your Hystrix circuit breaker:
